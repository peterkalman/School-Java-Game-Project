# School-Java-Game-Project
The game I made in 13th class while studying for my Technician degree. The game is inspired by XCOM and Rimworld and is called XComTactics.
This repository contains an entire project document and the functional game.

The game it self could be described as Bomberman , but what if we replaced the bombs with ranged weaponary and made the map randomly generated+destructable.
The goal is to kill the enemy that is chasing you through the map (using dijekstra's algorithem) before it does that to you.
The idea was first to make a squad based game in that format , hence the XCom Reference where each squaddie would have it's own range of weapons and effects, but time was short.
I had to settle on the single person game.
The Rimworld part is where I stripped most of the graphics for this game, I had no time designing my own ,and am willing to admit it. 
I took it from a mod actually called Hardcore-SK-Rimworld, it's pretty old now.

Overall I had a lot of fun making this.
